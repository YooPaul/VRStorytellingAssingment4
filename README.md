# VRStorytellingAssingment4


Demonstrates the use of spatial sound in VR. 

There is one ambient sound playing in the background and another sound made by the whale swimming in a circle. The sound from the whale
is spatialized, causing the amplitude of the sound to adapt based on the distance of the audio source from the camera. 

Run the .exe file to try the spatial sound demo.
